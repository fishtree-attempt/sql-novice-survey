## How to Store Data?

Three common options for storage are text files, spreadsheets, and databases.

## Text

*   Easy to create, work well with version control
*   But then we have to build search and analysis tools ourselves

## Spreadsheets

*   Good for simple analyses
*   But don't handle large or complex data sets well

## Databases

> ### database (dā'tə-bās') noun {.callout}
> "A collection of data arranged for ease and speed of search and retrieval by a computer"
> - The American Heritage® Science Dictionary

*   Include powerful tools for search and analysis
*   Can handle large, complex data sets.
