title: Introduction to Databases and SQL

In the late 1920s and early 1930s,
William Dyer,
Frank Pabodie,
and Valentina Roerich led expeditions to the
[Pole of Inaccessibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_inaccessibility)
in the South Pacific,
and then onward to Antarctica.
Two years ago,
their expeditions were found in a storage locker at Miskatonic University.
We have scanned and OCR'd the data they contain,
and we now want to store that information
in a way that will make search and analysis easy.

We basically have three options:
text files,
a spreadsheet,
or a database.
Text files are easiest to create,
and work well with version control,
but then we would then have to build search and analysis tools ourselves.
Spreadsheets are good for doing simple analysis,
they don't handle large or complex data sets very well.
We would therefore like to put this data in a database,
and these lessons will show how to do that.
